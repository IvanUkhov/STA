A multiprocessor system is a subject of uncertainties. In this paper, we model two sources of uncertainties: the process variation, discussed in \secref{process-variation}, and environmental noise, discussed in \secref{noise}. Both components affect the dynamic power dissipation as well as the leakage power. Consequently, the actual power consumption of the system can deviate from the nominal values, becoming a \rv. The leakage power was shown to be considerably more sensible to the process variation than the dynamic part. However, when the leakage is negligible small, the variations in the dynamic power play the key role. In this paper, we take into consideration variations in both components.
