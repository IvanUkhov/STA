A multiprocessor system is a subject of uncertainties.
% The major sources of uncertainties are:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Process variation of the platform.
%   \item Various input data of the application.
% \end{itemize}
% Therefore, the dynamic power profile and, consequently, temperature profile are uncertain.
