The \definition{transient temperature analysis} (TTA) delivers a set of curves, one for each of the thermal nodes, that describe the thermal behaviour of the system through the time horizon of the given power profile $\powerprofile$.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
The sources of uncertainties are the process variation and a random noise.

Given:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A multiprocessor system $\system = (\platform, \physics)$.
  \item A nominal dynamic power profile $\powerprofile$.
  \item Additional knowledge about uncertainties as specified in the following subsections.
\end{itemize}

Find:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The probability distribution of the temperature profile $\temperatureprofile$ with respect to $\powerprofile$.
\end{itemize}

First, the sources of uncertainties are modeled separately (\secref{tta-process-variation} and \secref{tta-noise}), and then they are joined together into a single model (\secref{tta-process-variation-noise}).
