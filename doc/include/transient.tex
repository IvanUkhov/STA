The \definition{transient temperature analysis} (TTA) delivers a set of curves, one for each of the thermal nodes, that describe the thermal behaviour of the system through the time horizon of a dynamic power profile $\pprofile{\dyn}$. Since the given power profile is a mean (nominal) profile, we denote it by $\mpprofile{\dyn}$.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
Given:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A multiprocessor system $\system$.
  \item A mean dynamic power profile $\mpprofile{\dyn}$.
  \item The variation ratio matrix $\mratio_\dyn$ and correlation matrix $\corr{\vpower_\dyn}$ of the dynamic power.
  \item A mean leakage power $\vmean{\leak}$.
  \item The covariance matrix $\cov{\vpower_\leak}$ of the leakage power.
  \item The covariance matrix $\cov{\noise}$ of the environmental noise.
\end{itemize}

Find:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The probability distribution of the temperature profile $\tprofile{}$ with respect to $\mpprofile{\dyn}$.
\end{itemize}

First, the sources of uncertainties are modeled separately (\secref{tta-process-variation} and \secref{tta-noise}), and then they are joined together into a single model (\secref{tta-process-variation-noise}).
