Suppose the system at each moment of time is affected by a random noise, symbolically denoted by $\noise$. The nominal parameters of the platform and ambience are assumed to be known, however, due to the noise (caused by, for instance, varying environmental conditions), the actual power dissipation and, consequently, temperature fluctuations are uncertain. In this paper, we assume that $\noise$ is the white noise with known covariance matrix $\covariance{\noise}$.

The presence of the noise is modeled with an additional term, $\noise$, in the right-hand side of \equref{fourier}. Due to the assumptions, $\noise$ is a \mnrv\ with $\nodecount$ components (one for each thermal node), i.e., $\noise \sim \normal(\vzero, \covariance{\noise})$. Since the covariance matrix is a real symmetric matrix, it can be diagonalized using the eigenvalue decomposition as $\covariance{\noise} = \m{U} \m{\Lambda} \m{U}^T$, where $\m{U}$ is a orthogonal matrix of the eigenvectors and $\m{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues \cite{press2007}. Consequently, the noise is decomposed into $\noise = \mnoisedeviation \vstdnormal_\time$, where $\mnoisedeviation = \m{U} \m{\Lambda}^{1/2}$ and the stochastic process $\{ \vstdnormal_\time \}_{\time \in \timeset}$ is the standard $\nodecount$-dimensional white noise \cite{oksendal2003}, a set of vectors of independent \snrvs, i.e., $\vstdnormal_\time \sim \normal(\vzero, \mone)$. Hence, we have the following stochastic process:
\begin{equation} \equlabel{fourier-noise}
  \mcapacitance \frac{d\vtemperature_\time}{d\time} + \mconductance \vtemperature_\time = \vpower + \mnoisedeviation \vstdnormal_\time
\end{equation}
\equref{fourier-noise} can be rewritten in the differential form:
\begin{equation} \equlabel{fourier-wiener}
  d\vtemperature_\time = \mcapacitance^{-1} (\vpower - \mconductance \vtemperature_\time)d\time + \mcapacitance^{-1} \mnoisedeviation d\m{W}_\time
\end{equation}
where $d\m{W}_\time = \vstdnormal_\time d\time$ with $\{ \m{W}_\time \}_{\time \in \timeset}$ being the Wiener process or Brownian motion \cite{oksendal2003}. The integration of \equref{fourier-wiener} cannot be done in the regular Riemann-Stieltjes sense, since the Brownian motion is nowhere differentiable, therefore, a special calculus should be applied. We follow the It\^{o} interpretation \cite{oksendal2003} of the stochastic differential equation in \equref{fourier-wiener}. It can be seen that the stochastic process $\{ \vtemperature_\time \}_{\time \in \timeset}$ is a multidimensional standard (i.e., Gaussian) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process \cite{kloeden1992} driven by the Brownian motion. In order to solve \equref{fourier-wiener}, we apply the It\^{o} formula \cite{oksendal2003} to the function $\ecg{}{t} \vtemperature_\time$, where $e^\m{A}$ denotes the matrix exponential of $\m{A}$, and obtain:
\begin{align*}
  d(\ecgt \mtemperature_\time) & = \cg \ecgt \vtemperature_\time d\time + \ecgt d\vtemperature_\time \\
  & = \ecgt \mcapacitance^{-1} (\vpower d\time + \mnoisedeviation d\v{W}_t)
\end{align*}
The solution can be found by taking integrals on both sides:
\begin{align} \equlabel{solution-full}
  \vtemperature_\time = & \emcgt{} \vtemperature_0 - \\
    & (\cg)^{-1}(\emcgt{} - \mone) \mcapacitance^{-1} \vpower + \nonumber \\
    & \int_0^\time \ecg{}{(s - \time)} \mcapacitance^{-1} \mnoisedeviation \; d\m{W}_s \nonumber
\end{align}
To simplify the further derivation, we introduce the following notation:
\[
  \v{D}_\time = \int_0^{\time} \ecg{}{(s - \time)} \mcapacitance^{-1} \mnoisedeviation \: d\m{W}_s
\]
Therefore, taking into consideration \equref{a} and \equref{b}, \equref{solution-full} can be rewritten:
\[
  \vtemperature_\time = \m{A}(\time) \vtemperature_0 + \m{B}(\time) \vpower + \v{D}_\time
\]
Since the Wiener process has independent normally distributed increments, an integration with respect to it, i.e., $\int_0^\time f(s) dW_s$, is a \nrv. It can also be shown that in this case the mean is zero and variance is equal to $\int_0^\time f^2(s) ds$. Hence, $\v{D}_\time \sim \normal(\vzero, \covariance{\v{D}_\time})$, i.e., $\v{D}_\time$ is a \mnrv\ with a zero mean vector and the following covariance matrix:
\begin{align}
  \covariance{\v{D}_\time} & = \int_0^\time \ecg{2}{(s - \time)} (\mcapacitance^{-1} \mnoisedeviation)^2 \; ds \nonumber \\
  & = (2 \cg)^{-1} (\mone - \emcgt{2}) (\mcapacitance^{-1} \mnoisedeviation)^2 \equlabel{covariance-d}
\end{align}
Consequently, $\m{B}(\time) \vpower + \v{D}_\time \sim \normal(\m{B}(\time) \vpower, \: \covariance{\v{D}_\time})$.
