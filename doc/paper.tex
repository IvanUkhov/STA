  % \section{Problem Analysis}
  % Stochastic temperature analysis consists of two parts. In the first part, using statistical inference methods, we obtain knowledge on random variables that are present in the system. This knowledge includes parametrized probability distributions of the execution time and power dissipation of each task $\task \in \taskset$. In the second part, based on the estimated distributions, we construct stochastic thermal models capturing certain aspects of the temperature behaviour.

  % \section{Extraction of Uncertain Parameters}
  % Assume, there is a prior knowledge on the uncertainties presented in the system, i.e., families of probability distributions and their parameters. However, some of the parameters may be unknown. To estimate such parameters, we simulate the process a sufficient number of times and collect relevant statistical information (samples). Based on the obtained samples, the posterior knowledge is formed, i.e., particular probability distributions and their parameters are chosen.
